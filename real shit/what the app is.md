problems we solving? (in order of priority)
1. make leisurely content consumption genuinely enjoyable.
2. make you a productivity machine.
3. make work actually fun.

how tf we gonna do this?

- extension-level url and web content filtering (copy dns filtering)
	- tools:
		- block access to specific domains
		- block specific images/videos
		- force usage of native content filters
		- specific filter algorithms on some websites (e.g. yt), created by me, controlled by the app
	- overview:
		- running list of blocked/whitelisted domains and keywords are kept
		- your ai manages this running list (i.e. you can ask it to "block everything related to valorant")
		- running list of domains/keywords in which images are blocked/allowed (also managed by the ai)
		- running list of domains in which native content filters are forced
		- specific filter algorithm for youtube (more coming soon?) + controls for it
		- leisure/work mode means 2 different versions of all these lists
- needs to be a custom browser (because that's sexy af)
- block all other web browsers + apps
- mobile version
- mobile + desktop sync
- sexy tab management (copy sigmaos)

- work/leisure mode
- do url and web content filtering based on context of work project (copy the owl shit)
- constant check-ins (copy thefocusproject)

- dopamine-inducing web usage/work stats
- just a TINY bit of gamification (copy the worse clearspace)

how tf we gonna make $ off this?

monetise everything but how we make content consumption geniunely enjoyable (maybe even monetise ai content-filtering haha)
